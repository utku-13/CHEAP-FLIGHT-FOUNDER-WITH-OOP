# CHEAP-FLIGHT-FOUNDER-WITH-OOP
It is a code that gives flight ticket that is under your setted price(with google sheet).
The main goal of this code is finding a flight with the parameters that we created at first.
It finds flight compares it to a minumum price that we have already setted in some google sheet document.
And if it is cheaper than this flight. It sends an sms to my number.
